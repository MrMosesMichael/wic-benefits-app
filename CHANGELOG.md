## 2026-02-17 — MI APL Recovery + v1.5.0 Builds Shipped

**Diagnosed and resolved mass deactivation of 9,396 MI products (since Feb 10). Fixed parser_config brand column bug. v1.5.0 iOS + Android builds submitted.**

### Done
- ✅ Diagnosed: 9,396 MI products wrongly deactivated since Feb 10 — APL sync job ran with partial file, safeguard bypassed
- ✅ Confirmed scanner affected — `eligibility.ts` filters `active = true`; deactivated products returned "not eligible"
- ✅ Discovered MI APL now includes official "Brand Name" column — `enrich-upc.ts` no longer needed for MI
- ✅ Fixed `apl_source_config` parser_config: `"brand": "Brand"` → `"brand": "Brand Name"` (silent NULL mismatch)
- ✅ Fixed in `backend/migrations/019_apl_sync_monitoring.sql` to prevent regression on DB recreate
- ✅ Ran MI APL sync (force) × 2: first to restore 9,396 deactivated products, second to populate brand names
- ✅ Final state: 9,851 active MI products (up from 7,647), 9,851/9,851 branded from official source
- ✅ v1.5.0 iOS build submitted to TestFlight
- ✅ v1.5.0 Android build submitted to Google Play Console

### Files Modified
- `backend/migrations/019_apl_sync_monitoring.sql` — fix MI brand column name

### Commits
```
809af4a fix: MI APL parser_config brand column "Brand" → "Brand Name"
```

## 2026-02-17 — Product Catalog Smart Filtering + UPC Search

**Branded-first product browsing + UPC eligibility lookup. Hides ~55% low-quality entries by default, adds instant WIC eligibility check via UPC.**

### Done
- ✅ Backend: `branded=1` query param filters to products with non-empty brand
- ✅ Backend: `totalUnfiltered` count in response for "Show all (N)" display
- ✅ Backend: New `GET /lookup/:upc` endpoint with leading-zero padding fallback
- ✅ Frontend: Default `brandedOnly = true` — hides entries like "Skim", "2%", "Grade A"
- ✅ Frontend: Two-chip toggle ("Branded products" / "Show all")
- ✅ Frontend: UPC detection in search bar (all digits, >= 8 chars → auto-lookup)
- ✅ Frontend: Green "WIC Approved!" / orange "Not found" result banners
- ✅ Frontend: `lookupUPC()` service function
- ✅ i18n: 5 new keys in English + Spanish (showBranded, showAll, showingBranded, upcNotFound, upcFound)
- ✅ Version bumped to 1.5.0 (buildNumber "1", versionCode 10)

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/routes/product-catalog.ts` — branded filter + `/lookup/:upc` endpoint
- `app/app/catalog/products.tsx` — branded toggle UI + UPC detection
- `app/lib/services/catalogService.ts` — `lookupUPC()` + branded param
- `app/lib/i18n/translations/en.json` — 5 new catalog keys
- `app/lib/i18n/translations/es.json` — 5 new catalog keys (Spanish)
- `app/app.json` — version bump to 1.5.0

## 2026-02-17 — UPC Enrichment via Open Food Facts

**Bulk UPC enrichment using Open Food Facts API. Adds product names, brands, and sizes to MI APL products that only had UPC codes.**

```

## 2026-02-16 — NC & OR APL Product Data Enrichment

**Both states went from UPC-only entries to full product names, brands, categories, and subcategories.**

### Done
- ✅ Created `backend/src/scripts/reimport-apl.ts` — standalone APL reimport script
- ✅ NC: 16,952 products enriched from state APL Excel file
- ✅ OR: 14,013 products enriched from state APL Excel file
- ✅ Fixed missing category codes (`'16'` → whole_grains, non-padded NC codes)

- ✅ 0 uncategorized products remaining for both states

### Files Created
- `backend/src/scripts/reimport-apl.ts`

## 2026-02-15 — Kroger Background Batch Sync

**Cron-based inventory sync pipeline with DB-first cross-store search. Reduces per-request Kroger API calls from ~25 to near-zero when data is fresh.**

### Done
- ✅ Fixed `syncInventoryBatch()` retailer bug — was hardcoded `'walmart'`, now parameterized
- ✅ Cross-store search reads pre-synced inventory from DB before live API calls
- ✅ Live API fallback only for stores with stale/missing data (capped at 5 stores)
- ✅ `KROGER_INVENTORY_STALE_HOURS` env var (default: 4h) controls freshness threshold
- ✅ `--max-stores` and `--max-upcs` CLI flags for sync script
- ✅ Crontab configured on VPS: 3×/day sync (01:00, 09:00, 17:00 UTC) + weekly cleanup
- ✅ Zero-padded Kroger location IDs to 8 characters (API requirement)
- ✅ 12-digit UPC-A retry when 13-digit GTIN search returns no results
- ✅ Filtered out stores with invalid short location IDs from sync queries
- ✅ Deleted 4 manually-seeded stores with bad IDs (all had API-discovered replacements)
- ✅ `.claude/settings.local.json` gitignored (was blocking deploy script)

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/services/InventorySyncService.ts` — retailer param on `syncInventoryBatch()`
- `backend/src/services/KrogerIntegration.ts` — maxUpcs param, UPC-A retry, store ID filter, kroger retailer
- `backend/src/scripts/sync-kroger-inventory.ts` — `--max-stores`/`--max-upcs` flags, help text
- `backend/src/routes/cross-store-search.ts` — DB-first inventory lookup with live fallback
- `docker-compose.yml` — `KROGER_INVENTORY_STALE_HOURS` env var
- `ROADMAP.md` — Marked Kroger batch sync as done
- `CLAUDE.md` — Added Kroger sync commands and crontab to Production section
- `.gitignore` — Added `.claude/settings.local.json`

### Verification
- 29/29 inventory records synced (5 stores × 10 UPCs), 0 failures
- 32 total records: 11 in stock, 13 low stock, 8 out of stock
- Stats command correctly shows `retailer = 'kroger'`

## 2026-02-14 — Manual PLU Code Entry + Scanner Fix

**Fresh produce eligibility via manual PLU entry. iOS scanner mode toggle fix.**

### Done

- ✅ Bundled 324 IFPS produce PLU codes (203 fruits, 121 vegetables) for offline lookup
- ✅ PLU lookup service with organic detection (5-digit codes starting with 9)
- ✅ Result screen shows PLU label, CVB info note, hides sightings/cart for produce
- ✅ Unknown-but-valid PLU codes still show as eligible ("Fresh Produce")
- ✅ EN + ES translations for all PLU UI strings
- ✅ Fixed iOS bug: Check Eligibility / Shopping Mode toggle was untappable (overlay z-order)

### Files Created
- `app/assets/data/plu-codes.json` — bundled produce PLU lookup table
- `app/lib/services/pluLookup.ts` — offline PLU lookup service

### Files Modified

- FL only publishes visual food guides, not UPC-based APL
- Cron: `0 5 * * * cd ~/projects/wic-app && docker compose exec -T backend npm run apl-sync`

### Commits

---

## 2026-01-23 — Manual Entry UX Fix

**Fixed benefit category visibility**

### Done
- ✅ Enabled horizontal scroll indicator for benefit categories
- ✅ Added "scroll right for more" hint
