## 2026-02-25 — Category Rename + Feedback Pipeline (v1.7.3)

**Merged "Infant Formula", "Infant Meats", and "Baby Food Meat" into a single "Infant Foods" category. Added auto-sync hook for GitHub feedback issues.**

### Done
- ✅ **Category merge (fixes [#11](https://github.com/MrMosesMichael/wic-benefits-feedback/issues/11))** — Removed offensive "Infant Meats" name. Merged `infant_formula`, `infant_meats`, `baby_food_meat` → `infant_food` ("Infant Foods" EN / "Alimentos para Bebé" ES). Updated type definitions, category data, i18n (EN+ES), 5 UI screens, backend catalog, OCR parser, APL scripts, and bundled Michigan APL data.
- ✅ **Feedback sync pipeline** — Ingested and resolved open GitHub issue #11.
- ✅ **SessionStart hook** — `.claude/settings.json` auto-runs `sync-feedback.sh` on every Claude Code session start.
- ✅ Bumped to v1.7.3 (buildNumber 1, versionCode 15)

### Files Modified

## 2026-02-24 — Cart Fix + Scan Result Polish + Benefit Card Drill-Down (v1.7.1)

**Fixed the root-cause empty cart bug (backend cart bypassed in favour of AsyncStorage), added View Cart card to Scan Result screen, made benefit cards tappable with deep-link to Edit Benefits, added Next Month period preset, and added 🛒 emoji to home screen cart button.**

### Done
- ✅ **Bug: Cart always empty** — Created `cartStorage.ts`; all cart API functions (`getCart`, `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `clearCart`, `checkout`) now use AsyncStorage `@wic_cart`. Backend cart was unusable because it JOINs on integer participant PKs while local IDs are timestamp strings.
- ✅ **View Cart card on Scan Result** — `scanner/result.tsx` shows a green `🛒 View Cart (N items)` card whenever cart has items (checked on mount and after each add).
- ✅ **Tappable benefit cards** — `benefits/index.tsx`: individual benefit cards changed from `<View>` to `<TouchableOpacity>` → navigate to `/benefits/household-setup?participantId=<id>`. Participant header row also passes `participantId`.
- ✅ **Edit Benefits deep-link** — `household-setup.tsx` reads `participantId` param via `useLocalSearchParams`; auto-opens Edit Benefits view for that participant on mount.
- ✅ **"Next Month (1st)" period preset** — `manual-entry.tsx` period start date picker gains a third preset button.
- ✅ **🛒 emoji on home cart button** — `app/index.tsx` Shopping Cart card now shows `🛒`.
- ✅ Bumped to v1.7.1 (versionCode 13)

### Files Modified
- `app/lib/services/cartStorage.ts` — NEW: local cart storage service
- `app/lib/services/api.ts` — cart functions delegate to cartStorage
- `app/app/scanner/result.tsx` — View Cart card, cart count state
- `app/app/benefits/index.tsx` — tappable benefit cards with participantId param
- `app/app/benefits/household-setup.tsx` — deep-link participantId support
- `app/app/benefits/manual-entry.tsx` — Next Month (1st) preset
- `app/app/index.tsx` — 🛒 emoji on cart button
- `app/app.json` — v1.7.0 → v1.7.1, versionCode 12 → 13

## 2026-02-24 — iOS Defect Fixes + Home Screen Redesign + Polish (v1.7.0)

**Fixed 10 iOS defects from device testing, redesigned home screen with live WIC Balance section, extended KeyboardAvoidingView to all editing screens, and completed Spanish i18n for the balance section.**

### Done
- ✅ D1: Scan mode toggle removed — hardcoded to 'check' mode
- ✅ D2: Add to Cart always shown for eligible items; one-time household setup prompt with remembered preference (`@wic_cart_preference`)
- ✅ D3: Manual entry save implemented — real `loadHousehold`/`saveHousehold` flow with participant selector
- ✅ D4: Unit dropdown filters by category — `CATEGORY_UNITS` map, auto-selects default unit
- ✅ D5: All dropdowns scrollable — `ScrollView` wrappers with maxHeight
- ✅ D6: `KeyboardAvoidingView` in `household-setup.tsx` benefits editing view
- ✅ D7: Period settings now updates AsyncStorage directly (not backend-only API)
- ✅ D8: Auto-save on participant add and benefit save in `household-setup.tsx`
- ✅ D9: Participant header rows tappable → navigate to household setup
- ✅ D10: Empty benefit cards silently filtered on save (no error)
- ✅ UI1: Live WIC Balance section at top of home screen — loads on focus, shows "You have X, Y, and N other items remaining. Use by [date]."
- ✅ UI2–5: Reordered home cards, camera emoji on Scan, View Benefits card removed
- ✅ KAV extended to `manual-entry`, `log-purchase`, `feedback`, `complaint`, `location` screens
- ✅ WIC Balance restyled — text-based with bottom divider, not a card element
- ✅ Balance summary: deduplicates categories across participants, caps at 3 named + "and N other items"
- ✅ WIC Balance section fully translated — `home.balance.*` + all 13 category names + a11y keys in EN + ES
- ✅ Bumped to v1.7.0 (versionCode 12)

## 2026-02-17 — Spanish i18n Fixes + Brand Filter Chips (v1.6.0)

**Fixed all native-speaker-reported Spanish bugs. Added brand filter chips to Product Catalog with punctuation-normalized brand deduplication.**

### Done
- ✅ Spanish i18n — `household-setup.tsx` fully wired (was 100% hardcoded English)
- ✅ Spanish i18n — formula type chips translated (`cross-store-search.tsx`)
- ✅ Spanish i18n — FAQ category chips translated (`help/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Spanish i18n — "📍 Location Settings" button translated (`index.tsx`)
- ✅ es.json — carrito→carro throughout, `cart.startScanning`→"Escanea productos", `formulaAlerts.alertSetMessage` esté→está
- ✅ Brand filter chips in Product Catalog — top 30 brands per category, auto-fetch on category change
- ✅ Brand normalization — `REGEXP_REPLACE` strips apostrophes/punctuation (Mott's = Motts = MOTT'S)
- ✅ Brand filter hides during search/UPC lookup
- ✅ Bilingual: "All Brands" / "Todas las Marcas"
- ✅ Closed GitHub issues #6, #7, #9, #10

## 2026-02-17 — MI APL Recovery + v1.5.0 Builds Shipped

**Diagnosed and resolved mass deactivation of 9,396 MI products (since Feb 10). Fixed parser_config brand column bug. v1.5.0 iOS + Android builds submitted.**

### Done
- ✅ Diagnosed: 9,396 MI products wrongly deactivated since Feb 10 — APL sync job ran with partial file, safeguard bypassed
- ✅ Confirmed scanner affected — `eligibility.ts` filters `active = true`; deactivated products returned "not eligible"
- ✅ Discovered MI APL now includes official "Brand Name" column — `enrich-upc.ts` no longer needed for MI
- ✅ Fixed `apl_source_config` parser_config: `"brand": "Brand"` → `"brand": "Brand Name"` (silent NULL mismatch)
- ✅ Fixed in `backend/migrations/019_apl_sync_monitoring.sql` to prevent regression on DB recreate
- ✅ Ran MI APL sync (force) × 2: first to restore 9,396 deactivated products, second to populate brand names
- ✅ Final state: 9,851 active MI products (up from 7,647), 9,851/9,851 branded from official source
- ✅ v1.5.0 iOS build submitted to TestFlight
- ✅ v1.5.0 Android build submitted to Google Play Console

### Files Modified
- `backend/migrations/019_apl_sync_monitoring.sql` — fix MI brand column name

- ✅ Backend: `totalUnfiltered` count in response for "Show all (N)" display
- ✅ Backend: New `GET /lookup/:upc` endpoint with leading-zero padding fallback
- ✅ Frontend: Default `brandedOnly = true` — hides entries like "Skim", "2%", "Grade A"
- ✅ Frontend: Two-chip toggle ("Branded products" / "Show all")
- ✅ Frontend: UPC detection in search bar (all digits, >= 8 chars → auto-lookup)
- ✅ Frontend: Green "WIC Approved!" / orange "Not found" result banners
- ✅ Frontend: `lookupUPC()` service function
- ✅ i18n: 5 new keys in English + Spanish (showBranded, showAll, showingBranded, upcNotFound, upcFound)
- ✅ Version bumped to 1.5.0 (buildNumber "1", versionCode 10)

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/routes/product-catalog.ts` — branded filter + `/lookup/:upc` endpoint
- `app/app/catalog/products.tsx` — branded toggle UI + UPC detection
- `app/lib/services/catalogService.ts` — `lookupUPC()` + branded param
- `app/lib/i18n/translations/en.json` — 5 new catalog keys
- `app/lib/i18n/translations/es.json` — 5 new catalog keys (Spanish)

## 2026-02-16 — NC & OR APL Product Data Enrichment

**Both states went from UPC-only entries to full product names, brands, categories, and subcategories.**

### Done

## 2026-02-15 — Kroger Background Batch Sync

**Cron-based inventory sync pipeline with DB-first cross-store search. Reduces per-request Kroger API calls from ~25 to near-zero when data is fresh.**

### Done
- ✅ Fixed `syncInventoryBatch()` retailer bug — was hardcoded `'walmart'`, now parameterized
- ✅ Cross-store search reads pre-synced inventory from DB before live API calls
- ✅ Live API fallback only for stores with stale/missing data (capped at 5 stores)
- ✅ `KROGER_INVENTORY_STALE_HOURS` env var (default: 4h) controls freshness threshold
- ✅ `--max-stores` and `--max-upcs` CLI flags for sync script
- ✅ Crontab configured on VPS: 3×/day sync (01:00, 09:00, 17:00 UTC) + weekly cleanup
- ✅ Zero-padded Kroger location IDs to 8 characters (API requirement)
- ✅ 12-digit UPC-A retry when 13-digit GTIN search returns no results
- ✅ Filtered out stores with invalid short location IDs from sync queries
- ✅ Deleted 4 manually-seeded stores with bad IDs (all had API-discovered replacements)
- ✅ `.claude/settings.local.json` gitignored (was blocking deploy script)

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/services/InventorySyncService.ts` — retailer param on `syncInventoryBatch()`
- `backend/src/services/KrogerIntegration.ts` — maxUpcs param, UPC-A retry, store ID filter, kroger retailer
- `backend/src/scripts/sync-kroger-inventory.ts` — `--max-stores`/`--max-upcs` flags, help text
- `backend/src/routes/cross-store-search.ts` — DB-first inventory lookup with live fallback
- `docker-compose.yml` — `KROGER_INVENTORY_STALE_HOURS` env var
- `ROADMAP.md` — Marked Kroger batch sync as done
- `CLAUDE.md` — Added Kroger sync commands and crontab to Production section
- `.gitignore` — Added `.claude/settings.local.json`

### Verification
- 29/29 inventory records synced (5 stores × 10 UPCs), 0 failures
- 32 total records: 11 in stock, 13 low stock, 8 out of stock
- Stats command correctly shows `retailer = 'kroger'`

## 2026-01-22 — Offline Build + Manual Benefits Entry

**Standalone APK + manual benefits system**

### Done
- ✅ Built release APK (debug was launching Expo Go)
- ✅ Created household storage service (AsyncStorage)
- ✅ Built household setup screen (650+ lines)
- ✅ 14 benefit categories with participant management
- ✅ Data persists across app restarts

### Files Created
- `app/lib/services/householdStorage.ts`
- `app/app/benefits/household-setup.tsx`

### Technical Notes
- Release APK works standalone, debug APK requires Expo Go
- getBenefits() priority: AsyncStorage → mock data → backend API
