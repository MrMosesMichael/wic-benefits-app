### Support & Feedback System ✅ IMPLEMENTED

All three channels are live:

   - Auto-labels by category (bug, feature, question)

2. **Web Form** ✅
   - URL: `https://mdmichael.com/wic/support.html`
   - Posts to `/api/v1/feedback` endpoint

3. **In-App Feedback** ✅
   - Accessible from Help screen
   - Includes device info (platform, OS version, app version)
   - Full i18n support (English + Spanish)

### Privacy & Compliance

- ✅ Privacy Policy published: https://mdmichael.com/wic/privacy.html
- ✅ Data Deletion page published: https://mdmichael.com/wic/delete-data.html
- ✅ Google Play data safety form completed
- ✅ No third-party analytics/tracking (confirmed — no IDFA, no cookies, no pixel trackers)
- ✅ No Advertising ID usage
- ✅ Encryption: `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` set in app.json
- ✅ All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)

### App Review Preparation

**Common Rejection Reasons:**
1. ❌ Missing functionality (app crashes, broken features)
2. ❌ Misleading metadata (screenshots don't match app)
3. ❌ Privacy issues (undeclared data collection)
4. ❌ Incomplete information (broken support URL)

**Pre-submission Checklist:**
- [ ] Test all core features on physical device
- [ ] Verify barcode scanner works (camera permission granted)
- [ ] Test location services (food bank finder)
- [ ] Confirm no crashes or critical bugs
- [x] Support URL is live and working
- [ ] Screenshots accurately represent current app
- [x] Privacy policy reflects actual data practices

**Review Timeline:**
- TestFlight internal: Usually 1-24 hours
- App Store review: 24-48 hours average
- Rejections: Can resubmit immediately after fixes

### Release Strategy

**Phase 1: TestFlight Beta** 🔄 Current
- Internal testing (you + up to 100 App Store Connect users)
- Fix critical bugs
- Gather initial feedback

**Phase 2: External TestFlight** ⏳ Next
- Up to 10,000 external testers
- Requires Apple review per build
- Useful for broader testing before public release
- **Action items:**
  1. In App Store Connect → TestFlight → External Testing, create a group (e.g., "Beta Testers")
  2. Add the build to the external group — this triggers an Apple review (typically 24-48 hours)
  3. Once approved, enable the public link (TestFlight → External Testing → group → Enable Public Link)
  4. Copy the public link and update `deployment/wic-landing/index.html` — replace the placeholder TestFlight URL with the real one
  5. Optionally add a "What to Test" description for testers

**Phase 3: App Store Release**
- Submit for review
- Release options: Manual, automatic, scheduled
- Monitor reviews and crash reports

### Tracking & Monitoring

**Built-in Tools (Free):**
- App Store Connect Analytics (installs, sessions, retention)
- TestFlight feedback
- Crash reports (automatic from iOS)

**Future Considerations:**
- Sentry (crash reporting)
- PostHog (privacy-friendly analytics)
- Firebase (if needed, but avoid for privacy)

## Partnership Strategy

### Retailer API Partnerships

**Goal:** Real-time inventory data for WIC-approved products

| Retailer | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Kroger** | 🔄 In Progress | API integration being built, developer account active |
| **Walmart** | ⏳ Planned | Reach out to business unit once app is live on stores |

**Strategy:** Having published apps on Apple/Google stores demonstrates legitimacy and user base, which strengthens outreach to retailer business development teams.

### Register LLC

**Goal:** Formal business entity for app store presence and partnerships

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Register LLC (state TBD)
- [ ] Update Apple Developer account org info
- [ ] Update Google Play Console developer info
- [ ] Update privacy policy with LLC name
- [ ] Update support pages and landing page
- [ ] Update app.json owner/org fields if needed

### Michigan MDHHS Outreach

**Goal:** eWIC API access for live balance integration

**Contacts:**
- michiganwic@michigan.gov (primary)
- DataRequest@michigan.gov (cc)

**Letter should include:**
1. Who you are + app purpose
2. User problem statement (formula shortages, benefit confusion)
3. Production app demo: https://mdmichael.com/wic/
4. Field testing results + user feedback
5. Proposed partnership model
6. Security/compliance capabilities
7. Request for exploratory meeting

**Timeline:** 12-18 months from initial contact to API access (typical)

**eWIC Processor:** FIS (Fidelity National Information Services)

### Grant Opportunities

| Grant | Amount | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| AWS Imagine Grant | Up to $200K + $100K credits | Spring 2026 deadline |
| AWS Nonprofit Credits | $1,000 | Promotional |
| Azure for Nonprofits | $2,000/year | Via TechSoup |

---

## Technical Debt

| Item | Impact | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Backend product routes disabled | Low (scanner works offline) | Low |
| Store data not imported | Medium (empty search results) | Medium |
| No authentication system | High (using demo household) | High (pre-launch) |
| Java 17 requirement undocumented | Low | Low |

---

## Success Metrics (Human Flourishing)

Track these, not DAU/retention:

1. **Checkout Humiliation Prevented** — Scans that correctly identified ineligible items
2. **Time Returned to Families** — Shopping time saved vs. manual checking
3. **Benefits Fully Utilized** — % of benefits used before expiration
4. **Stress Reduction** — User-reported confidence in shopping
5. **Formula Crisis Response** — Time to find formula during shortages
6. **Knowledge Democratization** — FAQ views that prevented wasted trips

---

## Governance (Future)

This app should be owned by users, not exploited by corporations.

**Options:**
- 501(c)(3) with majority WIC participant board
- User cooperative (WIC participants as members/owners)

**Anti-patterns to NEVER add:**
- ❌ Data harvesting for retailers/insurers
- ❌ Behavioral nudges
- ❌ Health shaming
- ❌ Paternalism
- ❌ Fraud detection for state agencies
