  // ELIGIBILITY - Package sizes (CRITICAL)
  {
    id: 'package-sizes',
    question: 'What package sizes are WIC-approved?',
    answer: `WIC approves specific package sizes for each food category. This is one of the most common reasons items get rejected at checkout.

**General Rules:**
• Each state's Approved Product List (APL) specifies exact sizes
• Size must match EXACTLY — close isn't good enough
• Multi-packs may have different rules than single items

**Michigan Examples:**
• Milk: 1/2 gallon or gallon (not quarts)
• Eggs: 1 dozen only (not 18-count)
• Cheese: 8 oz or 16 oz blocks (varies by type)
• Cereal: 12-36 oz boxes (varies by brand)
• Juice: 64 oz bottles (frozen may differ)

**Pro Tip:** Use this app's scanner to verify! It checks both the product AND the size against your state's current APL.`,

  // SHOPPING - Checkout rejection (CRITICAL)
  {
    id: 'checkout-rejected',
    question: 'Why was my item rejected at checkout?',
    answer: `Items can be rejected at checkout for several reasons, even if they seem like they should be WIC-approved:

**Most Common Reasons:**

1. **Wrong Size** — The exact package size isn't on the APL
   • Example: 24 oz cereal when only 18 oz is approved

2. **Wrong Brand** — Store brand vs name brand matters
   • Some items require specific brands
   • Formula is especially strict about brands

3. **Wrong Variety** — Same brand, different product
   • Example: Cheerios ✓ but Honey Nut Cheerios ✗
   • Example: 2% milk ✓ but chocolate milk ✗

4. **Benefits Exhausted** — Already used your allowance
   • Check your remaining benefits in the app

5. **Benefits Expired** — Past your benefit period end date

6. **Store System Error** — Rare, but happens
   • Ask the cashier to re-scan or try another register

**What to Do:**
• Don't argue at checkout — it's stressful and rarely helps
• Note the item and check it in this app later
• Ask for a manager if you believe it's a store error
• Contact your WIC office if it keeps happening`,

  // FORMULA - Stock checking (CRITICAL)
  {
    id: 'formula-stock',
    question: 'How do I know if formula is in stock?',
    answer: `Finding formula in stock can be challenging, especially during shortages. Here's how to check:

**Using This App:**
1. Go to the Formula Finder from the home screen
2. Select your formula type
3. See stores with recent stock reports
4. Check confidence scores (higher = more recent/reliable reports)

**Other Methods:**
• Call the store before going
• Check store websites/apps (Walmart, Target, etc.)
• Ask your WIC office — they sometimes get shortage updates

**Understanding Stock Reports:**
• 🟢 "Plenty" — Multiple units available
• 🟡 "Some" — A few units spotted
• 🟠 "Few" — Very limited, go soon
• 🔴 "Out" — None seen

**Report What You See:**
Help other parents! When you shop, report formula stock in the app. Your report helps build a community picture of what's available.

**Formula Shortage Tips:**
• Check multiple stores in your area
• Go early in the morning when shelves are restocked
• Ask about delivery schedules
• Consider equivalent formulas (ask your WIC office first)`,

  // BENEFITS - Understanding the three states
  {
    id: 'benefit-states',
    question: 'What do Available, In Cart, and Consumed mean?',
    answer: `Your benefits have three states that help you track usage:

**🟢 Available (Green)**
Benefits you can still use. This is your spending power.

**🟠 In Cart (Amber)**
Items you've added to your cart but haven't purchased yet. This helps you plan your trip without over-buying.

**⬜ Consumed (Gray)**
Benefits you've already used this period. These are spent.

**How It Works:**
1. Start of month: All benefits are Available
2. Add items to cart: Moves from Available → In Cart
3. Log a purchase: Moves from In Cart → Consumed
4. Remove from cart: Moves back from In Cart → Available

**Why This Matters:**
• Prevents embarrassment at checkout from over-shopping
• Helps plan shopping trips
• Shows at a glance what you have left`,

  // BENEFITS - Benefit period
  {
    id: 'benefit-period',
    question: 'When do my benefits expire?',
    answer: `WIC benefits expire at the end of each benefit period:

**Key Facts:**
• Benefits are typically monthly
• Unused benefits do NOT roll over
• Your period dates are set by your WIC office

**Check Your Dates:**
Go to Benefits → look at the expiration date under each category

**Don't Lose Benefits:**
• Shop before the end date
• Check remaining amounts regularly
• Plan your trips to use everything

**Tip:** Set a reminder a few days before your period ends to use remaining benefits.`,

  // SHOPPING - Scanning products
  {
    id: 'scan-products',
    question: 'How do I scan products to check eligibility?',
    answer: `Use the scanner to verify products BEFORE checkout:

**How to Scan:**
1. Tap "Scan Product" on the home screen
2. Point your camera at the barcode
3. Hold steady until it beeps
4. See instant eligibility results

**What You'll See:**
• ✅ Eligible — Good to buy with WIC
• ❌ Not Eligible — Won't work with WIC benefits
• ⚠️ Check Size — Product is WIC-approved but verify the size

**Tips:**
• Scan in the store while shopping
• Check items you're unsure about
• Works offline with Michigan products`,

  // FORMULA - Alternatives
  {
    id: 'formula-alternatives',
    question: 'Can I get a different formula if mine is out of stock?',
    answer: `You may be able to substitute formula, but there are rules:

**Important:** Always contact your WIC office before switching formulas, especially for medical formulas.

**General Guidelines:**
• Same brand, different size: Usually OK
• Different brand, same type: May need approval
• Different formula type: Requires WIC office approval
• Medical/specialty formulas: ALWAYS need approval

**Contract Brand:**
Your state has a "contract brand" that's the default. Switching between contract brand products is usually easier than switching to other brands.

**Michigan Contract Brand:** Currently Similac (as of 2024)

**How to Request a Change:**
1. Call your local WIC office
2. Explain the shortage situation
3. They can update your benefits for approved alternatives

**In the App:**
The Formula Finder shows alternative formulas that may work for your situation.`,

  // APP - Manual entry
  {
    id: 'manual-entry',
    question: 'How do I enter my benefits manually?',
    answer: `If automatic benefit loading isn't available, you can enter benefits from your WIC printout:

**Steps:**
1. Go to Benefits screen
2. Tap "Add Benefits Manually"
3. Select the participant
4. Choose the benefit category
5. Enter the amount from your printout
6. Set your benefit period dates

**Where to Find Your Amounts:**
• Your WIC benefits printout (given at appointments)
• Your eWIC card receipt
• Your state's WIC app or website

**Tip:** Enter benefits right after your WIC appointment when you have the printout handy.`,

  // APP - Household setup
  {
    id: 'household-setup',
    question: 'How do I set up my household?',
    answer: `Set up your household to track benefits for everyone:

**Steps:**
1. Go to Benefits screen
2. Tap "Setup" or "Set Up Household"
3. Add each participant (pregnant, infant, child, etc.)
4. Enter their name and type
5. Add their benefits

**Participant Types:**
• Pregnant
• Postpartum (not breastfeeding)
• Breastfeeding
• Infant (0-12 months)
• Child (1-5 years)

**Why It Matters:**
Different participants get different benefits. Setting this up correctly ensures accurate tracking.`,

  // SHOPPING - Reporting sightings
  {
    id: 'report-sighting',
    question: 'How do I report product availability?',
    answer: `Help other WIC families by reporting what you see in stores:

**How to Report:**
1. Scan a product
2. Tap "Report Stock"
3. Select your store
4. Choose stock level (Plenty, Some, Few, Out)
5. Submit

**Stock Levels:**
• 🟢 Plenty — Good supply, multiple units
• 🟡 Some — Moderate amount
• 🟠 Few — Very limited
• 🔴 Out — None available

**Why Report:**
• Helps other parents find products
• Builds community knowledge
• Reduces wasted trips
• Especially valuable for formula!
