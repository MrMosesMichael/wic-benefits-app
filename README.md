# WIC Benefits Assistant

A mobile app that helps WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program participants maximize their benefits through real-time product eligibility checking, store inventory awareness, and personalized shopping guidance.

## The Problem

WIC participants face daily challenges:
- Not knowing if a product is covered until checkout rejection
- Finding eligible products that are actually in stock
- Tracking remaining benefits across multiple family members
- Navigating large stores to find WIC items
- Losing unused benefits at month end

## The Solution

Scan. Shop. Smile.

- **Scan any product** - Instant WIC eligibility check for your state
- **Track your benefits** - See what's available, what's in your cart, what's been used
- **Find what's in stock** - Real-time inventory at your current store
- **Never miss a benefit** - Smart reminders before benefits expire
- **Find formula fast** - Emergency formula finder during shortages
